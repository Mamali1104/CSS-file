    <h1>Ozymandies</h1>
    <!--poem"s name-->
    <h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
    <!--poem-->
    <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
        Who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
        stand in the desert. . . . near them, on the sand,<br>
        half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
        tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
        Which yet survice, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br>
        My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, king of kings;<br>
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
        Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away."
